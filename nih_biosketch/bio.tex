\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}
% I have the expertise, leadership, training, expertise and motivation necessary
% to successfully carry out the proposed research project.  I have a broad
% background in psychology, with specific training and expertise in ethnographic
% and survey research and secondary data analysis on psychological aspects of
% drug addiction.  My research includes neuropsychological changes associated
% with addiction.  As PI or co-Investigator on several university- and NIH-
% funded grants, I laid the groundwork for the proposed research by developing
% effective measures of disability, depression, and other psychosocial factors
% relevant to the aging substance abuser, and by establishing strong ties with
% community providers that will make it possible to recruit and track
% participants over time as documented in the following publications.  In
% addition, I successfully administered the projects (e.g.\ staffing, research
% protections, budget), collaborated with other researchers, and produced several
% peer-reviewed publications from each project.  As a result of these previous
% experiences, I am aware of the importance of frequent communication among
% project members and of constructing a realistic research plan, timeline, and
% budget.  The current application builds logically on my prior work. During
% 2005--2006 my career was disrupted due to family obligations. However, upon
% returning to the field I immediately resumed my research projects and
% collaborations and successfully competed for NIH support.

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \begin{bibunit}[nih]
  \textbf{Optical control of molecular torsion.}
  A central challenge in high-accuracy molecular beam experiments is deriving highly detailed atomistic
  reaction mechanisms, because cross sections must be averaged over all possible orientations and
  available vibrational states of
  the molecules in the beam. I proposed and simulated schemes to optically control electronic
  properties, molecular chirality, and molecular conductance of biaryl compounds through laser control over
  intramolecular vibrational modes.\cite{Parker2011JCP224301}
  Torsion in biaryl compounds---molecules with two aromatic moieties connected by a bond about which the barrier
  to rotation is small---mediates the electronic coupling between the two rings in the molecule, thus controlling
  the electron transfer and transport rates, the absorption and emission spectra, and the
  molecule's chirality.
  By tuning the pulse parameters and
  polarization, I showed that absorption spectra can be shifted, that free internal rotation can be started or
  that the molecular chirality
  can be inverted.\cite{Parker2011JCP224301} This control was extended when, with the aid of optimal control theory,
  I designed ``deracemizing'' control pulses, i.e., control
  pulses that convert a racemic mixture into an enantiopure mixture.\cite{Parker2012MolPhys1941}
  Furthermore, I showed that optical control could be combined with mechanical force to achieve
  enhanced control over the conductivity of biphenyl-dithiol in a molecular junction.\cite{Parker2014NanoLett4587}
  This type of fine control over molecular conductance is especially interesting in the case of molecular electronics,
  where external control of conductance is critical to constructing molecular circuits.

  \item \begin{bibunit}[nih]
  \textbf{Excited-state electronic structure of molecular aggregates.}
  To shed light on the detailed mechanism of electronic processes like singlet fission,
  I pioneered the active space decomposition (ASD) method, together
  with Prof. Toru Shiozaki at NU, which was specifically designed to describe electronic processes
  in molecular aggregates.\cite{Parker2013JCP021108} Within ASD, the total wavefunction of an aggregate is
  constructed from fragment local wavefunctions.\cite{Parker2013JCP021108} ASD naturally leads to
  compact model Hamiltonians that bridge first-principles methods with chemical intuition and huge
  computational speed ups such that calculations can be performed on workstation computers
  that otherwise would be impossible even on today's most powerful supercomputers.
  I used ASD to compute model Hamiltonians from first principles for singlet fission in tetracene and pentacene
  with unprecedented accuracy that confirmed the dominance of the charge-transfer mediated mechanism
  in the acenes.\cite{Parker2014JPCC12700}
  ASD was also used to build model Hamiltonians
  for processes such as electron/hole transfer, excitation energy transfer, and triplet excitation transfer.\cite{Parker2014JCTC3738}
  I further extended ASD to treat multiple sites using the density matrix renormalization group method
  to avoid the exponential scaling with respect to number of monomer units.\cite{Parker2014JCP211102}
  Thus, ASD has been established as a computationally efficient, broadly applicable tool to understand
  electronic processes in (possibly covalently bound) molecular fragments, thereby offering a solution
  to a long-standing conundrum to combine the accuracy and rigor of \textit{ab initio} methods with
  the interpretability of model approaches.

  \textbf{Nonlinear electronic spectroscopy: successes and pitfalls.}
  Nonlinear spectroscopy is a suite of powerful tools to characterize complex systems, investigate fundamental chemical
  physics, and drive chemistry. Widespread use of simulated nonlinear spectroscopic
  properties has been stymied, however, by the high cost of quadratic response implementations using hybrid density
  functionals.

  I published a highly resource-efficient implementation of the quadratic response function---including excited-state
  absorption (ESA), two-photon absorption (TPA), and second harmonic generation (SHG) amplitudes---in Turbomole.\cite{Parker2018JCTC807}
  The implementation pursued the dual purpose of enabling calculations of nonlinear
  properties of molecules with 100s of atoms and 1000s of basis functions using hybrid density functionals and of
  clarifying the consequences of the quadratic response function's incorrect pole structure.\cite{Parker2016JCP134105}

  In addition, I showed that quadratic response functions from approximate theories diverge
  unphysically,\cite{Parker2016JCP134105} raising additional questions about the reliability of nonlinear response theory.
  Using the new implementation, I showed that the incorrect pole structure of the TDDFT quadratic
  response function within the adiabatic approximation leads to serious deficiencies in related properties, including
  unphysical divergences in excited-state absorption spectra, overly resonant two-photon absorption spectra, and spurious
  poles in the dynamic hyperpolarizability.\cite{Parker2016JCP134105,Parker2018JCTC807}
  However, in cases where the spurious resonances can be avoided, I showed that
  semiquantitative results suitable for molecule screening or analysis can be obtained, thus facilitating computational
  design of nonlinear optically active or two-photon active materials with greater realism and for larger systems than was
  previously possible.

  \textbf{Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with TDDFT.}
  Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is
  emerging as a powerful technique to unravel the precise details of complex excited-state reactions.
  I contributed to the growth of the field by demonstrating its capacity for photoreactivity mechanism discovery
  and extending this paradigm to reactions involving more than one excited state.

  Together with colleague's during my postdoc, I performed the first fully unconstrained on-the-fly NAMD
  simulations of the first step of the oxygen evolution reaction on small hydrated \ce{TiO2} nanoclusters
  using surface hopping (SH) coupled with TDDFT.\cite{Muuronen2017ChemSci2179}
  Such on-the-fly simulations allow for truly exploratory mechanism \emph{discovery}, i.e., no
  prior knowledge of the mechanism is required. On the basis of our simulations, we proposed that the reaction is driven by
  electron-proton transfer (EPT) from physisorbed water to a photohole strongly localized on a bridging (\ce{Ti-O-Ti})
  oxygen atom. This proposed mechanism is consistent with the observed pH dependence as well as the
  observed production of mobile hydroxyl radicals and could not be observed computationally without the fully consistent
  model including exciton-binding. The identification of a detailed mechanism opens the door to designing photocatalysts
  with greatly improved efficiency.

  I also implemented nonadiabatic couplings between excited states, paving the way for photodynamics
  involving multiple excited states, such as the photodeactivation of thymine.\cite{Parker2019}
  In particular, I showed that excited-state lifetimes (153 fs for \ce{S2} and 14.1 ps for \ce{S1}) obtained
  from SH-TDDFT simulations are in excellent agreement with experimentally observed lifetimes (100--200 fs and
  5--7 ps); indeed, among all investigated electronic structure methods---including ADC(2) and CASSCF---only TDDFT produces
  qualitative agreement with experimental results, despite its low computational cost.
  This work thus adds to the mounting evidence that SH-TDDFT strikes an ideal cost-to-performance balance.
