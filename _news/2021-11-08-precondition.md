John's paper showing how to speed up TDDFT calculations using a
semiempirical model as a preconditioner was accepted for publication
in _The Journal of Chemical Physics_.
The paper is called ["Accelerating molecular
property calculations with semiempirical preconditioning"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0071013).
In the paper, John combines the simplified TDDFT (sTDDFT) semiempirical models
with iterative Krylov space methods to speed up _ab initio_ TDDFT calculations by
a factor of 1.5-3 with no tradeoff in accuracy.
