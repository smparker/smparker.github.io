Our collaborative paper with the Sauv√© group (CWRU) was accepted for publication in
_Inorganic Chemistry_. In the paper, titled "Tuning the properties of
azadipyrromethene-based near-infrared dyes using intramolecular BO-chelation
and peripheral substitutions",
John used DFT calculations to understand the structural origin of the
optical and electronic properties of near IR dyes.
