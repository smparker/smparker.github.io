John Zhou's paper introducing the TDDFT-ris model was recently published in _The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters_.
In this paper, we introduce a minimal auxiliary basis set approach to approximate TDDFT using a resolution-of-the-identity
approximation with just a single s-function per atom. TDDFT-ris reproduces TDDFT excited states with a mean error of about 0.06 eV
while reducing the cost by a factor of 200-300.
The full paper is titled
["Minimal Auxiliary Basis Set Approach for the Electronic Excitation Spectra of Organic Molecules"](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c03698).
