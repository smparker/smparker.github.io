Our collaborative paper with the [Spitale group at the University of California Irvine](http://www.spitalelab.com) was accepted for publication in
_Organic Letters_. In the paper, titled "Mutually orthogonal bioconjugation of vinyl nucleosides for RNA metabolic labeling",
John and Srijana used DFT calculations to explain the origin of the observed
mutual orthogonality of two reactions used to label vinyl nucleosides: one based on a Diels-Alder reaction with
maleimide and the other based on a phospha-Michael addition reaction with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP).
