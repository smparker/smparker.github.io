title: Collaborative work on synthesis and structure of γ-graphyne published in JACS

Parker Group’s graduate student Ericka Roy Miller has published computational analysis supporting the synthesis
and characterization of multilayer γ-graphyne, an exciting new semiconductor material. γ-graphyne is well poised
to be the foundation of next generation of carbon-based devices, due to its direct band gap, ultrafast charge
carrier mobility, strong physical durability, and high thermal conductivity. This work is part of an ongoing
collaboration with the Rodionov Group in CWRU’s Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering.

["Scalable Synthesis and Characterization of Multilayer γ-Graphyne, New Carbon Crystals with a Small Direct Band Gap"](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c06583).
