The group's contribution to the
[cyclobutanone prediction challenge](https://publishing.aip.org/publications/journals/special-topics/jcp/prediction-challenge-cyclobutanone-photochemistry/)
is now published online in _The Journal of Chemical Physics_.
This paper was a true group effort, with Ericka and Sean leading the way.
For this prediction challenge, groups were tasked with predicting the photochemical
dynamics of cyclobutanone after being excited by 200 nm light. What made this
challenge especially exciting is that all of these contributions will be stress tested
by comparing to ultrafast electron diffraction experiments that were performed
concurrently with the simulations. In effect, it was a double-blind experiment
to definitively answer the question: "Just how predictive are our simulations, really?"
The full paper is titled
 ["Ultrafast Photochemistry and Electron Diffraction for Cyclobutanone in the S<sub>2</sub> State: Surface Hopping with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory"](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0203679).
