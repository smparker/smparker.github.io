      We are a group of quantum chemists captivated by the way light can drive, control, and
      probe chemical reactions as well as by the way that chemical reactions can produce
      light. We design broadly applicable electronic structure theories that tackle the open
      theoretical challenge of predicting the mechanisms and outcomes of complex
      photochemical reactions from first principles. The mechanistic insights from these
      developments are then be employed to accelerate the advancement of technologies to
      use light for on-demand inexpensive power and for directed stereospecific synthesis.

      The theories we develop are then turned into highly efficient programs (written in
      modern C++) that enable fully exploratory simulations of photochemistry akin to
      numerical “experiments”, including associated spectroscopy that, in collaboration with
      experimental chemists, supply the microscopic details needed to answer fundamental
      questions governing photo(electro)chemistry in molecular materials that have
      implications in chemistry, physics, material science, biology, and medicine.
