- title: Fast nonlinear properties calculations for predicted transient spectra through a minimal-auxiliary basis set method
  status: declined
  source: Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Awards Program
  amount: $100,000
  start: 7/1/2023
  end: 6/30/2027
  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: We will develop a fast approximation for predicting nonlinear and transient spectra from first-principles
             time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), called TDDFT-ris, that will retain the high accuracy of
             TDDFT but reduce the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.

- title: Controlling the Donor and Acceptor Distance, Orientation, and Motions in Donor-Acceptor DNA Biophotonic Materials to Optimize their Energy Transfer Efficiencies
  status: pending
  source: NSF DMREF
  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: "The overall objectives include a comprehensive series of experiments in which the
    team will: 1. Investigate the role of donor-acceptor distances (discretely ranging from 3 Å to 100 Å with
    nominal orientation variation) on RET and disentangle the electronic and vibrational excited-state dynamics.
    Identify the vibrational marker bands associated with different excited state species in the femtosecond to
    nanosecond timescale. 2. Investigate the role of donor-acceptor orientation (with nominal distance variation)
    on RET and disentangle the electronic and vibrational excited state dynamics. Identify the vibrational marker
    bands associated with different excited state species in the femtosecond to nanosecond timescale. 3.
    Identify the effect of DNA microenvironment (electronic coupling of nucleotides adjacent to the
    donors/acceptors) on RET through high-throughput computational photochemistry and time-resolved
    spectroscopy rather than brute-force experimental synthesis. 4. Investigate multistep electronic and
    vibrational excited state dynamics in the presence of intermediary photonic molecules (donor intermediary
    acceptor) and identify distance and orientation conformations for tunable chromaticity."
