  amount: $100,000
  start: 7/1/2023

  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: We will develop a fast approximation for predicting nonlinear and transient spectra from first-principles
             time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), called TDDFT-ris, that will retain the high accuracy of
             TDDFT but reduce the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.

- title: Computing Nonlinear Optical Phenomena at All Orders Through the Action Lagrangian Eigenvalue Problem
  status: declined
  source: Cottrell Scholar Award - Research Corporation for Science Advancement
  amount: $120,000
  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: "Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are an important class of materials
    defined by their ability to respond to multiple quanta of light in unique
    ways. Molecules with controllable NLO properties have a wide range of
    potential applications, including photodynamic therapeutics, biosensing,
    microscopy, ultrafast spectroscopy, and all-optical computing. However,
    accurately predicting NLO properties for molecules of technological
    interest remains challenging because of severe limitations with
    state-of-the-art methods, especially when moderate light intensities are
    desired, as in NLO processes. I propose a new approach to simulating NLO
    properties using the Action Lagrangian Eigenvalue Problem (ALEP) that will
    allow for efficient and robust simulations at arbitrary light intensities.
    An attractive feature of the ALEP is that all NLO processes will be
    included on the same footing to all order, including, for example,
    multiphoton absorption and excited-state absorption.

    Computational chemistry and chemical informatics have rapidly become central
    aspects of modern chemical research, but the undergraduate chemistry curriculum
    at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) has not kept pace with this change. I
    propose to enrich the undergraduate experience at CWRU by introducing
    stand-alone modules on cheminformatics into the introductory courses of the
    undergraduate curriculum. In addition, I will develop data-driven chemistry
    research project templates that will be used to provide hands-on research
    experience opportunities for students that are unable to join active research
    groups in the department. These research project templates will introduce
    chemical computation and information research to a small but significant
    population of students currently underserved by our curriculum."

  status: declined
  source: NSF DMREF
  amount: $2,000,000
  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: "The overall objectives include a comprehensive series of experiments in which the
    team will: 1. Investigate the role of donor-acceptor distances (discretely ranging from 3 Å to 100 Å with
    nominal orientation variation) on RET and disentangle the electronic and vibrational excited-state dynamics.
    Identify the vibrational marker bands associated with different excited state species in the femtosecond to
    nanosecond timescale. 2. Investigate the role of donor-acceptor orientation (with nominal distance variation)
    on RET and disentangle the electronic and vibrational excited state dynamics. Identify the vibrational marker
    bands associated with different excited state species in the femtosecond to nanosecond timescale. 3.
    Identify the effect of DNA microenvironment (electronic coupling of nucleotides adjacent to the
    donors/acceptors) on RET through high-throughput computational photochemistry and time-resolved
    spectroscopy rather than brute-force experimental synthesis. 4. Investigate multistep electronic and
    vibrational excited state dynamics in the presence of intermediary photonic molecules (donor intermediary
    acceptor) and identify distance and orientation conformations for tunable chromaticity."
