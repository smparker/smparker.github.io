- title: Fast nonlinear properties calculations for predicted transient spectra through a minimal-auxiliary basis set method
  status: pending
  source: Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Awards Program
  amount: $100,000
  start: 7/1/2023
  end: 6/30/2027
  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: We will develop a fast approximation for predicting nonlinear and transient spectra from first-principles
             time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), called TDDFT-ris, that will retain the high accuracy of
             TDDFT but reduce the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.
  commitment: 0.5 months/year

  source: NSF, Division of Material Research
  location: Case Western Reserve University
  objective: Unravel the influence of vibronic dynamics on the control of resonance energy transfer in
    large donor-acceptor systems by designing DNA nanostructures, measuring the ultrafast dynamics
    using transient spectroscopy, and simulating the structural dynamics
